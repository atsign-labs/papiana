# papiana

This is a play on dart's pana tool, standing for "Public API ANAlysis".

## What does this do?

This project is designed to compare the public APIs of two packages and return a list of conflicts to the user.

## Project Status

Work on this project has been halted for the time being, unit tests are incomplete and it is unlikely that the tool is capable of detecting certain corner cases. i.e. the tool may have some false negatives, so it is not recommended to rely on this tool in it's current state.

Contributions to this tool are more than welcome!
